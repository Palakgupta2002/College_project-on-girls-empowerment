<h2>Admin Dashboard</h2>
<p>Admin authentication is a crucial security feature in web applications that allows only authorized administrators to access and manage sensitive or administrative functionalities. It involves validating the login credentials provided by the user against the stored credentials in the system's database.

Here's how admin authentication typically works:

1. **Admin Login Page:**
   - The web application provides a dedicated login page specifically for administrators to enter their login credentials.

2. **Username and Password:**
   - The admin is required to enter their unique username and password, which serves as their authentication credentials.

3. **Secure Transmission:**
   - The login credentials are transmitted securely over HTTPS to protect them from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

4. **Authentication Process:**
   - Upon submitting the login form, the application performs an authentication process to verify the admin's identity.

5. **Database Check:**
   - The application checks the entered username against the database to find the corresponding admin account.

6. **Password Hashing:**
   - The admin's password is securely hashed and stored in the database to protect it from being accessed or seen in its original form.

7. **Password Verification:**
   - The application retrieves the hashed password from the database and compares it with the hashed version of the entered password.

8. **Successful Authentication:**
   - If the entered username and password match the stored credentials, the admin is successfully authenticated, and access is granted.

Admin authentication is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of administrative functionalities within a web application. By allowing only authorized administrators to access sensitive areas, it helps prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Additionally, it helps maintain an audit trail, as each admin's actions can be associated with their unique authentication credentials. Properly implementing admin authentication is a fundamental step in securing web applications and protecting valuable data and resources.</p>
